# Test Blog Post: Simple Security Setup

This is a test blog post to verify the Jekyll setup is working correctly.

## Step 1: Initial Discovery

During testing, I found an interesting endpoint that accepts user input:

```http
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "test123"
}
```

The server responds with a token in the response.

## Step 2: Analyzing the Response

I examined the response and noticed the token structure:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9",
  "user": {
    "id": "12345",
    "role": "user"
  }
}
```

This revealed that the application uses JWT tokens for authentication.

## Step 3: Testing the Vulnerability

I wrote a simple Python script to test the token:

```python
import requests
import json

def test_auth():
    url = "https://example.com/api/login"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    data = {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "test123"
    }
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Login successful")
        token = response.json()['token']
        print(f"Token: {token}")
    else:
        print("Login failed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_auth()
```

The test confirmed the application was vulnerable to the attack.

## Conclusion

This test post demonstrates the blog setup with code snippets and multiple steps.
